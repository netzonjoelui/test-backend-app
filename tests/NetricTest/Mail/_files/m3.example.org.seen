Fair river! in thy bright, clear flow 
Of crystal, wandering water,
Thou art an emblem of the glow 
Of beautythe unhidden heart
The playful maziness of art
In old Alberto's daughter; 

But when within thy wave she looks
Which glistens then, and trembles
Why, then, the prettiest of brooks 
Her worshipper resembles;
For in his heart, as in thy stream, 
Her image deeply lies
His heart which trembles at the beam 
Of her soul-searching eyes.
