<h1>Welcome to Messages!</h1> 

<p>
This is one central place for incoming communications and notifications generated throughout netric. If anything needs your attention, it will show up in your inbox.
</p>

<p>
If you have a smart phone that supports Microsoft&trade; Exchange, then you can automatically push all netric communications to your phone. <a href="javascript:loadSupportDoc(151);">Click here</a> to find out how.
</p>

<p>
You can also configure netric to check your <a href="javascript:loadSupportDoc(295);">existing email</a> or even <a href="javascript:loadSupportDoc(296);">handle all incoming email</a> for your organization. If you prefer to use your current email client (such as Microsoft Outlook) you can retrieve netric messages by <a href="javascript:loadSupportDoc(297);">adding an IMAP or POP3 account</a>.
