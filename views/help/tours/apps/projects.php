<h1>Managing Tasks &amp; Projects</h1> 

<p>
We all have work to do, and this application makes tracking and collaborating on tasks and projects easy. A task is what we use to represent actual work, and projects are logical groupings of bigger jobs that contain tasks and more.
</p>

<p>You can use this tool to create and <a href="http://www.netric.com/blog/posts/simple-and-life-changing-sytem-for-managing-tasks" target="_blank">manage your own tasks</a>, and also create tasks for others by changing the owner. When you  assign a task to anyone else in your team, it will automatically notify them in their "Messages" inbox and through email where they can accept and even comment on the assigned task. Once they finish the task and set it as completed, you will be notified.</p>

<p>To get started, create a new project (on the left) and invite members to join the project. To create a new task that belongs to that project, simply click the "Tasks" tab in the project and select "New Task." There is more, so much more, you can do with projects, but you'll discover that as you use it.</p>
