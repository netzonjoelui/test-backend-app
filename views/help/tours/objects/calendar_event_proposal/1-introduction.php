<h1 class='helpTourTitle'>Welcome to Event Proposals</h1>
<p>Trying to get everyone together at the same date and time can be a challenge. Use this simple tool to allow attendees to select from a list of optional times.</p>

<h3>Here's How it Works</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Create an event proposal, and add multiple "optional" times. There is no limit to the number of options you add but we suggest limiting it to 2-5 to keep things simple.</li>
	<li>Add your attendees (IMPORTANT). Attendees can be netric users, contacts, or just email addresses.</li>
	<li>Save. This will send invitations to all your attendees and the fun begins. Attendees will receive a link to a page that allows them to indicate which of the optional times will work for them. All attendees see what everyone else reported which gives them the chance to adjust as needed. They can also collaborate with each other by leaving comments.</li>
	<li>Once all attendees have reported back, click the "Create Event" link at the bottom of the best time, and create an event which will send final invitations to all your accepted attendees.</li>
