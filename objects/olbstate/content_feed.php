		<h3>No Content Feeds Created Yet</h3>
		<p>
			A feed is a logical grouping of content where updates are added with posts like on a blog. Content feeds are often used for blogs but can also be used for news updates and virtually anything else that requires regular posted updates.
		</p>
		<p>
			Feeds also have built-in RSS links making syndication of data easier than ever. To get started click "New Content Feed" above.
