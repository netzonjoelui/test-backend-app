		<h3>Time tracking is easy using this simple tool</h3>
		<p>
			Use this to track how much time you spent working on a task or project. 
			Either click "New Time Log" above to manually track time or click "Log time Spent" form within a task.
		</p>
		<p>
			Logging time spent working on tasks will automatically update the "cost" of that task so you can compare
			estimated cost with actual cost when the task is finally finished.
