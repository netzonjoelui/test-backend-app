		<h3>No Tasks Here Yet</h3>
		<p>
			Never let a important task slip through the cracks again! 
			Manage all your tasks in one convenient location where they can be assigned to users and link to projects, milestones, customers and more
			which makes prioritizing and managing large amounts of tasks easy. 
		</p>
		<p>
			TIP: If you assign a task to someone else (change the owner) they will be notified via email.
