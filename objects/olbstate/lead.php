		<h3>Manage Valuable Leads</h3>
		<p>
			There are no leads created here just yet, but it's easy to get started. Just click "New Lead" above.
		</p>
		<p>
			Leads are used to qualify possibilities for deals or partnerships. You can sort of think of a 
			leads as a spam filter for people and organizations. For example, if you are selling houses and a 
			12 year old kid submits a contact request on your website, you probably wouldn't want to include 
			that contact in your prospective customer database.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once you determine a lead is a valid opportunity, it should be
			<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="loadSupportDoc('289');" title="Click to view more information" target="_blank">converted to a contact</a>.
