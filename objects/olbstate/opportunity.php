		<h3>Get Started With Opportunities</h3>
		<p>
			There are no opportunities created here just yet, but it's easy to get started. Just click "New Opportunity" above.
			An Opportunity is just what it sounds like, it is used to manage an opportunity to conduct business or close a deal.
		<p>
		<p>
			This tool can be used to manage the life-cycle of your deals from quoting to closing. Additionally, managing sales/deal possibilities within this tool will provide greater visibility into what is going on which will ultimately translate to more sales!
