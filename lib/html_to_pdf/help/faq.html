<dt>Can I call this script from the command line?</dt>
<dd>
Probably yes; check if your PHP support command line interface. Also, consider reading this article on php.net:
<a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.php">Using PHP from the command line</a>
</dd>

<dt>All I'm getting is a blank page; no error messages in PHP error log. Whats happened?</dt>
<dd>Probably script runs out of memory or execution time. Try increasing the values of 
max_execution_time and/or memory_limit PHP configuration variables. Recommended values 
are 120 seconds and 16 megabytes. Nevertheless, if you're using the <i>VERY</i> big images,
probably you need to increase these values even more.</dd>

<dt>I've increased the limits, but still sometimes getting a blank page immediately after script starts! 
Some sites are parsed, though...</dt>
<dd>Some users encountered this problem using GD library bundled with PHP. While it matched the 
GD version requirement, it sometimes caused PHP to silently die on some images. The problem is solved 
by recompiling the PHP using the external (recent enough) GD library. Note that NOT ALL PHP configurations
are subject to this problem.</dd>

<dt>Generated Poscript files print very slowly or even do not print at all</dt>
<dd>
<p>
If you're sending PS directly to the printer, you should keep in mind that image-containing PS require a 
lot of memory/computational resources to render due the way it is generated, so printer may just run out of
 memory trying to print it. 
</p>
<p>
You may consider using the Ghostscript ps2ps script as a printing filter, 
this should speed up the printing process, as most computations will be done by computer instead of printer.

<dt>Sites are cut-off on the right side when I'm using 640 pixels page width. What can I do?</dt>
<dd>
Nothing. Treat this as a feature. Just increase the page width. 
Most sites are <b>NOT</b> designed for such small resolutions and will cause 
a horizontal scrollbar to appear in browser in such case. 
</dd>

<dt>I've disabled the &quot;Keep screen pixel/point ratio&quot; and the page layout is completely broken! 
What can I do?</dt>
<dd>
Nothing. Treat this as a feature. If you want to get layout close to the image rendered by browser, <b>never</b>
disable this option. The only case when you'll need it is the case when you need to render text having
the <b>exact</b> size specified in points.
</dd>

<dt>How should I add headers or footers to generated Postscript?</dt>
<dd>
Use 'position: fixed'. <a href="samples/headfoot.html">Example</a> 
</dd>

<dt>I've added headers and footers to my HTML pages, but how I can prevent them from showing up in the browser?</dt>
<dd>
Use CSS @media rules; as you may specify which set of media rules script should use during conversion,
you may optionally show or hide particular page elements like navigation bars or headers in generated files.

<dd>
<dt><a name="fonts"></a>How can I use fonts other than standard (Times, Helvetica and Courier)?</dt>
<dd>
Follow these <a href="howto_fonts.html">instructions</a>
</dd>

<dt>Cyrillic symbols are not displayed in PS/PS2PDF output</dt>
<dd>Install <tt>sharatype-fonts</tt> package to your Ghostscript; 
the script is configured to use these fonts out-of-the-box.
</dd>

<dt>Chinese (Japanese, Arabic, etc...) symbols do not show on the page. What I need to do?</dt>
<dd>First of all, you'll need fonts containing these symbols; in most cases default fonts bundled with
Ghostscript or PDFLIB will contain only Western/Central European symbols. After you find fonts containing 
characters you need, you should install them instead of standard, using the answer for a question 
<a href="#fonts">&laquo;How can I use fonts other than standard (Times, Helvetica and Courier)?&raquo;</a></dd>
