<th>Parameter</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>

<tr class="even">
<td>URL</td>
<td>URL you're going to convert (page should be available via either <tt>http</tt> or <tt>https</tt>).
Note that <tt>http://</tt> prefix is prepended to this value 
automatically in case no http or https protocol part found,
thus you may set the value of this parameter, for example, to <tt>www.google.ru</tt>,
not <tt>http://www.google.ru</tt>.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="odd">
<td>pixels</td>
<td>
<p>'Virtual screen' horizontal resolution used during the render process. As you know, a lot of 
HTML pages contain dimensions set in pixels &ndash; image, in most cases; sometimes fonts. Postscript/PDF files
do not have &quot;pixels&quot;, all dimensions are measured in &quot;points&quot; so we need to provide 
information about pixel/point ratio. In our case, this ratio can be calculated as follows: 
<pre>R = (page full width in points - page horizontal margins in points) / virtual resolution</pre>

<p>Thus, you can specify resultion in 800 pixels and make pages designed for 800x600 resolution to fit your printed page 
exactly. 

<p><tt>form.php</tt> provides three default values for this parameter: 640, 800 and 1024; if you need
more exotic value, say 945, you may specify this in the script query string manually and still get 
correct results.

<p>Please note that pages may be cut off on the right side if they're designed for the higher resolution 
than you've specified (for example, if they have hardcoded table widths or wide images). It is a feature.
In such cases please consider increasing 'pixels' value.

<tr>
<td>scalepoint</td>
<td>
<p>When page contains both device-dependent (in pixels) and device-independent (in points) dimensions, 
we're in trouble. For example, imagine the page containing an absolute-positioned text inside the 
image; in this case, as display and paper have different sizes, point/pixel ratio will be different 
in browser window and file rendered by the script, possilibly breaking the page layout. To prevent
this, <tt>scalepoint</tt> option is used. 

<p>If this parameter is set, the HTML page &quot;points&quot; are
scaled to keep the mentioned ratio, so if you print the resulting file and measure fonts,
they will be smaller than you expect, but the page layout will be exactly the same as you see in 
browser window (well, to be honest, just close to it). If you want fonts to have their real size, 
disable this option.

<p>Note that this additional scaling applies to points only; such units as in, cm, mm and pc 
are not affected by this option.</td>

<td>media</td>
<td>Name of <a href="configuration.html#common" title="Media definitions in configuration file">predefined media</a> to use. Note that media name is case-sensitive!</td>
</tr>

<tr class="even">
<td>cssmedia</td>
<td>HTML page can contain stylesheets for different target media type; for example,
printable version of page may have navigation panes and banner hidden, version for handhelds may be specially formatted
to work on small displays and so on. By setting the value of this parameter, you determine which set of 
CSS rules will be used during PS/PDF rendering.</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>leftmargin, rightmargin, topmargin, bottommargin</td>
<td>Page margins (millimetres).</td>
</tr>

<tr class="even">
<td>landscape</td>
<td>Set this parameter to rotate the media to landscape orientation. Please note, that as 'virtual resolution' 
will remain the same, all page content will be scaled to fit the new page width.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="odd">
<td>pageborder</td>
<td>Set this parameter if you want the page border to be printed.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="even">
<td>encoding</td>
<td>Almost always encoding can be automatically detected using HTTP response header 
or META tags inside the HTML. Sometimes, encoding information is missing; you can specify encoding name as a 
value of this parameter.</td>

<td>debugbox</td>
<td>Set this option if you want to see boundaries of all boxes generated by the script. 
It is unlikely you'll need this option, as it is mostly for debugging purposes. </td>

<td>method</td>
<td>This option determines the type of script output:
<ul>
<li>ps &ndash; Postscript;</li>
<li>ps2pdf &ndash; PDF (converted from Postscript using Ghostscript utility);</li>
<li>pdflib &ndash; PDF generated using PDFLIB;</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>

<tr class="odd">
<td>pdfversion</td>
<td>This option determines the compatibility level of PDF to be generated; the higher level you use, more features
can this PDF contain, no the other side, high-level PDFs may not be read by older viewer versions. :
<ul>
<li>1.2 (Acrobat Reader 3)</li>
<li>1.3 (Acrobat Reader 4)</li>
<li>1.4 (Acrobat Reader 5)</li>
<li>1.5 (Acrobat Reader 6)</li>

</tr>

<tr class="even">
<td>output</td>
<td>The value of this parameter determines where how generated file will be handled:
<ul>
<li>0 &ndash; PDF file will be opened immediately (possibly in the same browser window). Note it will not work for Postscript files in most cases, 
they will be downloaded as usual;</li>
<li>1 &ndash; user will be prompted to download generated file;</li>
<li>2 &ndash; generated file will be <a href="configuration.html#common" title="How to configure this option">stored on the server</a>;</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>

<tr class="odd">
<td>compress</td>
<td>Set this option to generate compressed Postscript files. Possibly, you'll need 
this option only if you're working with Postscript (NOT PDF) files via 
Adobe Acrobat Distiller, as it does not support compressed Postscript. In any other
case, use compressed Postscript, as it will save your traffic.
</td>
</tr>

<tr class="even">
<td>html2xhtml</td>
<td>If you're absolutely sure you have valid strict XHTML page, you can set this option to
disable HTML-to-XHTML conversion and speed up script execution a little
. In any other case, do not set this option, as script
will not work with non-well-formed XML.</td>
